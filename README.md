# HybridMorph
Just a experiment with voxelmorph and synthmorph combination 


It the models in a folder named aptly 
If you want to load weights from the trained model please use the correct path in the code
HybridMorph_FewShots_WeightsLoad & HybridMorph_alphaVar_LoadWeights are the main two model gerating algoritms which vary by using different paramenter value of alpha and the number of real brain images used.


AlphaVarCSV_visual and FewShotCSV_visualizationLoss are just to comapre losses and see the difference with parameter traning.
